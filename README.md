Oh hi. Please excuse the lack of documentation or installation instructions in this `README.md`. I included this repo directly in my profile as a means to view the code that powers my portfolio site.

This website is built on Laravel because I intend to grow and evolve the site over time. Since the file structure can be a bit much, here are a few bits of code that I'd like to call out:

- **Linter configuration files** - This will not only give you an idea into my code formatting preferences, but there's also a configuration file builder.
  - `resources/config/helpers/buildLinterConfig.js`
  - `resources/config/linters`
- **Tailwind configuration files** - I use a custom Tailwind configuration file to create more helpful utilities classes.
  - `resources/styles/oscillator/tailwindcss`
  - `tailwind.config.js`
